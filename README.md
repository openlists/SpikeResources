## Spike Sorting

[Spike sorting](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike_sorting) is the process of the grouping spikes into clusters, that relate to putative individual neurons, for which there have been many proposed algorithms. The following resources relate specifically to spike sorting.

### Tutorials

Spike sorting tutorials:
- A [brief overview](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/image-and-signal-processing/spikeforest/) of spike sorting from the Simons Foundation
- A [tutorial](https://www.cambridgeneurotech.com/webinars/spike-sorting) from cambridge neurotech
- A [tutorial](https://cbmm.mit.edu/learning-hub/tutorials/computational-tutorial/introduction-spike-sorting) from CBBM
- A [collection of tutorials](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spiketutorials) from Spike Interface

### Spike Interface

[SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a collection of Python modules relating to spike sorting and associated processes.

The SpikeInterface ecosystem includes multiple related tool, including:
- [spikeextractors](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeextractors)
- [spiketoolkit](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spiketoolkit)
- [spikesorters](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikesorters)
- [spikecomparison](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikecomparison)
- [spikewidgets](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikewidgets)
- [spikemetrics](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikemetrics)

SpikeInterface includes the access to multiple algorithms that can be used through the tool, including this
[list of spike sorters](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install_sorters.html).

#### Spike Forrest

[SpikeForrest](https://spikeforest.flatironinstitute.org/) is a project that systematically compares multiple spike sorting algorithms.
